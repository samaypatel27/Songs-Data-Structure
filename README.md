# Portfolio Project

The purpose of this repository is a custom data structure project I created during Software II at The Ohio State University.
This project represents a data structure: SongList, based off a Song object, and implemented with Ohio State's Queue Components.

This project gave me a stronger understanding
 of the OSU software discipline while also giving me the flexibility to design something that reflected my interests.

## Recommended Steps to Get Started

This component is available for free use to anyone. To get started, you may clone the repository in git bash, or use the github desktop app.
