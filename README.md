# Portfolio Project

The purpose of this repository is a custom data structure project I created during Software II at The Ohio State University.
This project represents a data structure: SongList, based off a Song object, and implmented with Ohio State's Queue Components.

 I really enjoyed the portfolio project! It gave me a stronger understanding
 of the OSU software discipline while also giving me the flexibility todesign something that reflected my interests.
 This made the experience rewarding and enjoyable as I created a product I was proud of!
